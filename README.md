# Moisture_Monitor
Code for my 2024 summer project, the plant moisture monitor. This code takes input data from three moisture sensors and exports them to an sd card for plotting and trend tracking later, with an LED flag so the user can fix any errors mid test.

All main logic is contained in src/main.cpp and is made by me. 

This code is written for my seeeduino XIAO SAMD21 board, and was my first time using platformio to code with arduino C! I prefer VSC over the arduino coding environment, so it was great to be able to use different tools to achieve the same result.
